# HTML/CSS Refactor Project

In this project, you will be given a page in HTML/CSS built for you. Your job
is to follow the instructions below and make the necessary changes to the
HTML and CSS.

For every specification you complete, make a new branch and go through the
process of committing your changes, pushing, and merging when they're completed.

Clone the `Download Project` link below.

## Part 1: Nav

CSS:

- The links still have the bullets as default with `li` elements.
- The links should be spaced evenly along the `nav` instead of on the left.
- The links are also small and hard to read. Increase the font size and bold them.

## Part 2: Articles

HTML:

- The two articles should go one after the other instead of split by the `list`
section.
- In Article 1, split the last paragraph into two separate paragraphs.
- In Article 2, combine the two paragraphs into a single paragraph.

## Part 3: List

HTML:

- Right now the elements in the list aren't actual list elements. Make each fruit
an `li` element in an ordered list instead of an unordered list.
- The list should also be in alphabetical order.
- The list also seems long with there being a lot of empty space to the right of
it. Split the list into two columns.

## Part 4: Form

HTML:

- The order of the form is incorrect right now. What the order should look like
is:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Email
  - Comments
  - Submit button
- The last name element should only have one `input` element instead of two.
- The comments `input` seems rather small for lengthy comments. Make it a
multi-line text input.

CSS:

- Change the format from vertical to horizontal.

## Part 5: General Styling

- The color scheme for the page right now is very unappealing. Customize the color
scheme using a palette of your choosing. You may want to check out [coolors] to
generate complementary color schemes.

- Change the font to something softer (e.g. Arial, Helvetica).
